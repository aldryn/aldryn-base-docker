CVE-2015-5144 -- Header injection possibility since validators accept
newlines in input
========================================================================

Some of Django's built-in validators
(``django.core.validators.EmailValidator``, most seriously) didn't
prohibit newline characters (due to the usage of ``$`` instead of
``\Z`` in the regular expressions). If you use values with newlines in
HTTP response or email headers, you can suffer from header injection
attacks. Django itself isn't vulnerable because
``django.http.HttpResponse`` and the mail sending utilities in
``django.core.mail`` prohibit newlines in HTTP and SMTP headers,
respectively. While the validators have been fixed in Django, if
you're creating HTTP responses or email messages in other ways, it's a
good
idea to ensure that those methods prohibit newlines as well. You might
also want to validate that any existing data in your application
doesn't contain unexpected newlines.

``django.core.validators.validate_ipv4_address()``,
``django.core.validators.validate_slug()``, and
``django.core.validators.URLValidator`` are also affected, however, as
of Django 1.6 the ``GenericIPAddresseField``, ``IPAddressField``,
``SlugField``, and ``URLField`` form fields which use these validators
all strip the input, so the possibility of newlines entering your data
only exists if you are using these validators outside of the form fields
.
